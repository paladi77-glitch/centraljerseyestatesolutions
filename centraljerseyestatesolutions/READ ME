# Central Jersey Estate Solutions - Official Website

This repository contains the complete source code for the official website of Central Jersey Estate Solutions. The site is a modern, responsive, multi-page static website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, optimized for performance and easy deployment on Netlify.

## Description

Central Jersey Estate Solutions guides families through the complexities of the probate process, with a special focus on real estate matters. This website was created by cloning an existing WordPress/Divi site and rebuilding it from the ground up with clean, lightweight code. This approach ensures faster load times, better security, and seamless deployment on modern hosting platforms like Netlify.

## Features

* **Fully Responsive Design**: The layout adapts perfectly to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Multi-Page Structure**: The site includes dedicated pages for the homepage, a market evaluation form, and a cash advance form.
* **Interactive Elements**:
    * An auto-playing image slider on the homepage.
    * A fully functional FAQ accordion that allows users to expand and collapse answers.
* **Netlify Forms Integration**: All forms are ready for Netlify deployment and include:
    * `data-netlify="true"` attribute for automatic form detection.
    * Built-in reCAPTCHA (`data-netlify-recaptcha="true"`) for spam protection.
    * Honeypot fields for an extra layer of security.
* **Lead Generation Funnel**: A dedicated form allows users to download a "Probate Checklist" PDF after submitting their contact information, redirecting them to a thank-you page for the download.

## File Structure
