            <div class="faq-accordion">
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Probate</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>When a person dies, their last will and testament (assuming they prepared one in advance) is handled and their wishes for the distribution of their personal property implemented through a process called probate. Probate simply means the procedure by which their last written directives are legally certified as the final statement of their wishes regarding their worldly possessions (including any property or properties they may have owned). It also confirms the appointment of a person or entity the deceased person selected to administer their estate.</p></div></div>
                
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Probate Court</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>A probate court, which is sometimes referred to as a surrogate court, is a specialized court and legal process that deals with matters pertaining to the probate and the administration of the estate of deceased persons. These specialized courts ascertain and oversee that proper administration and distribution of the assets of a decedent (one who has died), determine and certify the validity of wills, enforce the provisions of a valid will (by issuing the grant of probate), prevent improper action or malfeasance by executors and administrators of estates, and provide for the equitable distribution of the assets of persons who die intestate (without a valid will).</p></div></div>
                
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Personal Representative</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Also known as an Executor or Executrix, this is the person designated by a will to manage the deceased's estate. It is their duty to ensure that the deceased person's wishes, as expressed in the will, are carried out. Some tasks include determining and protecting the specific assets of the estate, collecting and arranging for payment of debts, making sure estate taxes are calculated and paid, and assisting the attorney for the estate.</p></div></div>
                
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Joint Tenancy With Rights of Survivorship</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Joint tenants (or tenancy) with the right of survivorship (JTWROS) is a type of ownership of real property or financial assets in which all joint owners have equal portions of ownership that are immediately re-allocated to remaining owners if one or more owners dies.</p></div></div>
                
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Testate</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>This term refers to a person who has died and left a "Last Will and Testament" that specifies their wishes pertaining to the distribution of the assets of their estate following their death. In this case, the estate will be distributed according to the provisions of the will.</p></div></div>
                
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Intestate</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>This term refers to a person who has died and did not leave a "Last Will and Testament." In this case, the administration of the estate will be handled by the court of jurisdiction and according to the laws of the state.</p></div></div>
                
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Codicil</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>A codicil is a document, attachment or rider that is added to an existing will that modifies or supersedes existing provisions or adds new provisions. This is done as an alternative to redrawing the entire will and is often done to change a beneficiary or assign disposition of a particular property or define the rights of a specific beneficiary.</p></div></div>
            </div>

            <h3 class="faq-subheading">Probate Definitions And General Information</h3>
            <div class="faq-accordion">
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>How does the probate process work?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>An original will is delivered to court, a notice is published, a representative is certified, creditors file claims, assets are gathered, and finally, remaining assets are distributed.</p></div></div>
                
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>How long does probate usually take to complete?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Generally six months, but can take much longer due to delays.</p></div></div>
                
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Why is probate actually required?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>To legally transfer property titles, collect taxes, set deadlines for creditor claims, and ensure orderly distribution of the estate.</p></div></div>
                
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Is it necessary for all of the decedent's property to go through probate?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Not necessarily. Assets in joint tenancy or a living trust often pass to heirs without probate.</p></div></div>
                
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>How much does probate cost?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>It can cost 3% to 7% or more of the total estate value.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>If there is a really small estate, is probate still necessary?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Possibly. In some states, there are "simplified procedures" for estates below certain thresholds. However, if there is real estate involved or debts against the estate, full probate may be required or advisable.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>What goes on in the probate of an uncontested will?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>The executor files a petition with the court, notifies beneficiaries, and if no objections are received, the court approves the petition, appoints the personal representative, orders that taxes and creditors be paid, and requires reports to assure all property is accounted for and distributed according to the will.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Where is Probate handled?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>The appropriate court in the State and County where the deceased permanently resided at the time of their death is usually where probate is processed.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Can I handle probate without a lawyer?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>While there is usually no legal requirement to use a probate lawyer, probate is a formalistic procedure. One minor omission or missed deadline can cause everything to come to a grinding halt. It generally is a very good idea to "let a lawyer do it."</p></div></div>
            </div>

            <h3 class="faq-subheading">Definition and Duties of the Personal Representative / Executor / Executrix</h3>
            <div class="faq-accordion">
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>What happens when the person who dies owned land in multiple states?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>If the decedent owned out-of-state real property, the will must usually be submitted to probate in those other states as well. This is called "ancillary probate."</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Who is legally responsible for handling the probate process?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>If there is a will, the Personal Representative (executor or executrix) is usually responsible. If there is no will, an "administrator" is appointed by the court.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>What are the main duties of a personal representative?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Duties include: inventorying assets, receiving payments due, paying debts, filing taxes, and distributing property.</p></div></div>
                
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>If I am named as the personal representative, do I have to accept the job?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>No, you can decline. An alternate or a court appointee will take over.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Are personal representatives usually paid for their work?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes, typically a personal representative earns a fee of approximately 2% of the total value of the estate for their work. This can be mandated by law in some states.</p></div></div>
                
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>What happens if the personal representative fails to perform his or her duty?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>The representative is personally liable for any damages caused by neglecting their duties.</p></div></div>
                
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>What if someone objects to or contests the will?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>This begins a "Will contest," which can be costly and cause long delays.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>What is the basis for a will contest?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Typical objections include: the will was not properly drawn, signed or witnessed; the decedent lacked mental capacity; there was fraud, force or undue influence; or the will was a forgery.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>How can a will be "contested"?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>A contest is mounted by filing necessary documents with probate court. To successfully challenge a will, there must be sufficient evidence that the will was not created properly.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>What if there is no will?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>If a person dies without a will (intestate), the probate court appoints an Administrator to receive claims, pay creditors, and distribute property in accordance with state law.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>What happens if a will cannot be found?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Missing wills raise legal issues. The will may be missing because it was intentionally revoked, or it may be provable through a photocopy or lawyer's draft if there's evidence the original was duly signed.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>How can I find out if there was a will?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Check with the probate court in the County where the deceased lived. The will, if filed, will be available to the public.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>How can I avoid probate of my estate?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>One approach is through the use of a Living Trust that holds legal title to your property at the time of your death. The Trust is a legal entity which survives you after your death.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>How are creditors against the estate handled?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Creditors are notified of the death and have a fixed period of time to file claims. If approved by the personal representative, the bill is paid from the estate. If rejected, the creditor must sue the estate.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Do beneficiaries have to pay creditors out of their own pocket if the estate is insolvent?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Generally not. Unless the beneficiaries guaranteed payment or assumed liability, they should not have liability for the deceased's debts just because they are beneficiaries.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>How are taxes handled in probate?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Death triggers two tax events: it ends the decedent's last tax year for income tax purposes, and establishes the "estate" as a new tax entity. Various federal and state tax returns may need to be filed.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>After a will is created, can it be modified?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. A will can be modified with a codicil or replaced by a completely new will, as long as the person making the changes is competent.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Are provisions for the care and guardianship of minor children usually provided for in a will?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Often they are, but a court is not bound by these provisions and might overrule them if there was a specific reason to do so.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Are there any specific rules about how property can be disposed of?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Generally yes. A judge can void all or part of a will. You cannot change the effects of law just by stating your wishes in your will.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Can there be more than one designated personal representative?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>You could appoint co-representatives, but this could cause problems during probate if there is disagreement. Normally, one representative is all that is needed.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Is it necessary for the personal representative to live in the decedent's state?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>It depends on state laws, but usually isn't an absolute requirement, though it is usually easier for larger estates and real estate.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>How does "joint tenancy" affect a will?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Joint tenancy with right of survivorship (JTWROS) doesn't replace a will. If one owner dies, the other becomes sole owner. This means the property isn't part of the estate and is not subject to probate.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Must a will actually be read out loud to the family by the personal representative or attorney?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>This is generally a movie scenario and not done in real life. Usually, the personal representative provides notice of probate and parties can obtain copies from probate court.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Should a will provide a separate list that details and bequeaths specific personal property?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>If allowable in your state, the benefit is that the list can be changed from time to time without changing or adding codicils to the will.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>What are the actual requirements for a will to be valid?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Generally, a valid will must be hand-written or printed and signed by the testator. It must be witnessed by two (or more) disinterested parties who are of sound mind. The testator must have reached the age of majority and be of sound mind.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>What happens if a person dies without leaving a will?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>State laws provide a "default will" for intestate deaths. The spouse and children usually receive the property first. If none exist, it goes to parents, then siblings, grandparents, etc. If no family is found, property reverts to the state.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>When should I make a will?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Immediately. Death often comes as a surprise. Making a will represents doing the right thing for those you love. You should occasionally review your will to ensure it continues to represent your final wishes.</p></div></div>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question"><span>Who can or should draft my will?</span><span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>If you don't do it yourself (which is acceptable), only an attorney can legally draft a will for you. Personally drafted wills are often incomplete and may be held invalid under state laws.</p></div></div>
